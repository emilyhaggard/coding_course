<h2>Day 1</h2>
		<p>After a waking up very early we arrived at Stanstead for our flight to Barden Barden. This all went smothly and after buying some chocolate we were on our way to Germany!</p>
		<h3>If you play with fire then you going to get burned.</h3>
		<p>So we arrived at the bus station from the airport, and looked around expecting to see many camping shops, having heard how keen the Germans were on camping. After seeing know we asked the people in the train/bus station shop in a mixture of English and German. After some confusion over the difference between camping sites and camping gas, we were directed to a large out doors shop a bit along the motorway.
		So here started our walking. A 20 minute trek along the side of the motorway. When we arrived we found they didn't have the kind of liquid fuel we need. So we were forced to purchase camping gas and a new kind of stove to accomodate this. To see the continuation of the fire sage, read basically the rest of our dairy.</p>
	</br>
	<p> After a quick chocolate break, we headed back to the train station to continue our jouney to Phorhiem.</p>
