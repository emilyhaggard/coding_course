<h2>Day 1</h2>
		<p>After waking up very early we arrived at Stanstead for our flight to Barden Barden. This all went smoothly and after buying some chocolate we were on our way to Germany!</p>
		<h3>If you play with fire then you are going to get burned.</h3>
		<p>So we arrived at the bus station from the airport, and looked around expecting to see many camping shops, having heard how keen the Germans were on camping. After seeing no camping shops we asked the people in the train/bus station shop in a mixture of English and German. After some confusion over the difference between camping sites and camping gas, we were directed to a large outdoors shop a bit along the motorway.
		So here we started our walking. A 20 minute trek along the side of the motorway. When we arrived, we found they didn't have the kind of liquid fuel we need. So we were forced to purchase camping gas and a new kind of stove to accomodate this. To see the continuation of the fire saga, read basically the rest of our diary.</p>
