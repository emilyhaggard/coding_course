<h2>The Black Forest</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2014 we went to the Black Forest for 9 days of walking and camping. </p>
<h3>Planning for the Black Forest</h2>
	<p> Our planning could be described as between limited to nothing until right before the trip. Apart from booking our flights, quite early on to get them cheaper. Then a week before the trip we met up, with our map (which we had managed to buy), and planned our trains, buses, where we would walk and where we would stay.
		Luckily we already had most of the equipment we needed, including sleeping bags, sleeping mats, a tent and a tranger. One of the things we lacked was cooking fuel. As it is illegal to take compressed gas or lighter fuel on a plane, we decided to buy this in Barden Barden when we arrived. See Day 1 of the diary to hear this story. </p>
