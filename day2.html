<h2>Day 2</h2>
  <p>After a long nights sleep and a good breakfast at the Pfortheim youth hostel, we set off at the earlier hour of 9:30. Not because we were specifically that organised but because we had to check out at that time. Full of energy we shouldered our suprisingly heavy backpacks at set off to Schellbronn. </p>
  <p>Looking at our map the first thing we saw was the steap hill we had to climb almost immeduatly. With the limited amount of exercise that gets done in a uni term neither of us were at our peak fitness, and cetainly had not walked with 10-15kg on our backs for quite a while. Anyway with a lot of puffing and panting we made it to the top of the hill.</p>
  <p>Schellbronn turn out to be closer than we orgionally realised we took some detours (without taking any down hills so we would not have to go up again :)), to places like Wurm. By the time we reached Hohenwart the energy earlier in the day had warn off and we were ready to stop. Despite this on reaching Schellbronn we decided to try and find the local viewing point which the map claimed to have panoramic views. After walking for a considerable time to along the path the only thing that we got a view of were the trees of the Black Forest - admittaly beautiful- but not quite the glorious views we had expected. Dispirted we headed back towards the town and almost stopped to play on a childrens' playground but were too embarassed to do so when we saw the few parents and children there. Instead we headed on to the campsite. We then spent quite a while walking around what we could see was the campsite, failing to find an enterance. However by what felt like the 10th side of the square of the campsite we found the enterance and were able to take our pick of the few pitches resereved for those without cars. After a while of lieing on our bags not wanting to move we picked ourselves up to set up the tent. Luckily we had done this before and so this was done with limited incident. We then continued to collapse inside the tent for a good while, until hunger drove us to have  our first try with the stove.</p>
  <p>As always pasta and tomatoe sauce is an excellent camping dinner and we managed to make this without even pour the pasta down the drain due to the lack of a colinder. Feeling warm and full we headed off to the showers. At this point we were surprised to notice other people of our age in the campsite who had not been dragged there by their parents, admittedly they were in a cavervan not a tent. However we were surprised none the less. </p>
