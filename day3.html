<h2>Day 3</h2>
  <p> From Schellbronn we headed to Bad Liebenzell, via Neuhausen. This was a very beautiful part of our walk, especially when we walked down a steap valley. The beauty of this area was clearly know as the numbers of wakers increased from none to many. Stopping for lunch in this  valley, we climed over some stream to a rock above a large pool. Where we ate and dabbled our feet in the stream. We might have swam execpt for the many people passing us who were already commenting how cold our feet must be, making the logistics of swimming quite difficult. Also our feet were very cold.</p>
  <p>At this point the meat eater amoung us also decided open the tin of hearing that we had previously purchased. The smell of this was quite something although was appenrently quite pleasent. With only half the herring having been eaten we devised a way of getting rid of the juice and wrapping the tin in many plastic bags. Predictably this was unsucessful and at our next stop we saw the juice leeking out over the bags, and soaking into the backpack. As a result the backpack smelt of herring for most of the trip and the herring was  carefully left outside the tent that night.</p>
  <p>Continuing on our trip we arrived at a large cafe at the bottom of the valley, which helped explain the increase in the number of people walking. At the cafe was discovered ice cream for only 1 Euro a scoop! After indulging we continued on to Bad Libenzell.</p>
  <p>On arriving at the campsite we were pleased to find that the campsite had a swimming pool, which we made good use of for an hour. After cooking more pasta and sauce, with some of us eating herring as well. We went to sit by the plug sockets in the bathroom, to charge our phones and attempt to translate some Germany kids books. Soon after the rain started, and it poured down. We sprinted back to the tent and hid ourselves inside. We had heard that the weather would not be brilliant but we had not quite expeted the downfall we got.</p>
